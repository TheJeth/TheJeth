## Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:
- [Flight scheduler](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/PT59-FLIGHT-SCHEDULER) - This project streamlines flight scheduling for military pilots by automating the process, removing the need for manual organization and booking. Pilots can independently set and schedule their flights with confidence, minimizing the risk of cancellations and operational disruptions. Additionally, real-time weather forecasting has been integrated to provide pilots with up-to-date weather information, enabling them to make informed decisions and prepare effectively for their flights.
- [Evangelical Social Mission The Rock of Faith ]((https://github.com/TheJeth/MISEROF_Project_T)) -The Evangelical Social Mission the Rock of Faith (ESMIROF) app is developed for a Christian organization to enhance stakeholder visibility and facilitate efficient scheduling and sharing of routine activities. It enables members to provide feedback such as testimonies, manage and promote past and upcoming events. The app also supports responsible community management through secure, credential-based access for administrators.
